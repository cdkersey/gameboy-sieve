Sieve of Eratosthenes for Game Boy
==================================

This has been tested on higan, sdlgnuboy, bgb, and vba, but not a real Game
Boy. The hope is that anybody on Debian or any other distro that packages sdcc
can use this as the basis for their development environment, perhaps by
splitting some of the things in cart.c out into headers.

Tiles are edited in textual format in tiles.til, then converted by the
convtiles parser to C source code with a ".inc" extension that is then included
from cart.c. This non-compressed tileset is by far the bulk of the image size.
The assembled and linked output in Intel hex format is finally converted to a
.gb image by ihx_to_bin, which also adds the appropriate checksums to the
header.

This is meant to be a starting point for open source Game Boy development in
Linux but is by no means comprehensive.
